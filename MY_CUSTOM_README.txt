This is a project by Charles Siwele
The project is a minimalistic, hospitality reservations management desktop application.

The appliaction features a host of capabilites, primarily those of managing client reservations.
The project is on-going and much work is still needed to make it more robust (there are still features that may yield exceptions in some rare cases).
The application allows for the generation of pdf invoices and quotations, the tracking of client reservations, the creation and management of both system users and clients.
Feel free to peruse, and copy and use, as you will, for purposes of education only.
However, please forgive the terrible lack of comments, its terribly schelpy having to keep up with comments at times when you're heavily focused on code. 
And once you have a bulk of code hammmered down, it then gets terribly schlepy having to go back and add comments there and then.
Soooo.. I will in future re-commit further versions (with comments) and added features.


In order to run it effectively, you need to create the database and tables, and add an initial admin account to users table.

find the scripts for db and tables in resources folder ("Beit_Solutions_ERP_v1.1\Resources")
